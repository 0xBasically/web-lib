# Introduction
The Web Lib is a library that allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It's divided in two parts:
- The `logical` part, giving you access to a list of React standard `Hooks`, Web3 specific `Hooks`, Web3 specific `Contexts` and a bunch of utility functions.
- The `ui` part, giving you access to a list of standard React components and layouts to bootstrap your app in a few seconds.  
  
The `logical` part only require a few lines of code to get started, but the ui part requires some more configuration to correctly install TailwindCSS, the sCSS config and the presets.
