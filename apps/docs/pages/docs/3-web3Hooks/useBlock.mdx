# useBlock
Fetch the latest or any past block's information. This could also be used to subscribe to new blocks and be able to trigger events based on that.

```tsx
import {useBlock} from '@yearn-finance/web-lib/hooks';
```

## Usage

```tsx
import {useBlock} from '@yearn-finance/web-lib/hooks';

function App() {
	const	{data: block} = useBlock();

	return (
		<div>
			{`BlockNumber: ${block.number}`}
		</div>
	);
}
```

## Return Value

```tsx
{
	data: {
		hash: string
		parentHash: string
		miner: string
		extraData: string
		nonce: string
		number: number
		timestamp: number
		difficulty: number
		gasLimit: BigNumber
		gasUsed: BigNumber
		baseFeePerGas?: null | BigNumber
	}
	error?: Error
	isLoading: boolean
	isSuccess: boolean
	isError: boolean
}
```

## Configuration

### `blockHashOrBlockTag` (optional)
Block to fetch. This can be a number, a hash or a tag (e.g. `'latest'`). If not provided, the `latest` value will be used.
```tsx {5}
import {useBlock} from '@yearn-finance/web-lib/hooks';

function App() {
	const	{data: block} = useBlock({
		blockHashOrBlockTag: '123456'
	});
}
```

### `shouldWatch` (optional)
Boolean value, indicating if we want to watch for new blocks. This is useful if we want to subscribe to new blocks and be able to trigger events based on that. Default is `false`.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
	With `shouldWatch` enabled, the `data` property will be updated whenever a new block is added to the chain. The data is a basic React `state`, using the `useState` hook.  
	Because of the React lifecycle, once a new block is received, a re-render will be triggered, which could lead to some performance issues in some case.
</Callout>

```tsx {5}
import {useBlock} from '@yearn-finance/web-lib/hooks';

function App() {
	const	{data: block} = useBlock({
		shouldWatch: true
	});
}
```

### `shouldShallowWatch` (optional)
Boolean value, indicating if we want to watch for new blocks. This is useful if we want to subscribe to new blocks and be able to trigger events based on that. Default is `false`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="？">
	The difference between `shouldWatch` and `shouldShallowWatch` is that the `shouldShallowWatch` will not update the `data` property when a new block is added to the chain. Instead, this will trigger a callback function, `shallowCallback`. As it does not update the React `state`, no re0render is triggered.  
	You **MUST** provide a `shallowCallback` function to handle the new block.
</Callout>

```tsx {5}
import {useBlock} from '@yearn-finance/web-lib/hooks';

function App() {
	const	{data: block} = useBlock({
		shouldShallowWatch: true,
		shallowCallback(block, error?): void {
			console.log('shallowCallback', block, error);
		}
	});
}
```


### `shallowCallback` (optional)
Function to invoke when a new block is mined. This function is only triggered when `shouldShallowWatch` is enabled.

```tsx {6-8}
import {useBlock} from '@yearn-finance/web-lib/hooks';

function App() {
	const	{data: block} = useBlock({
		shouldShallowWatch: true,
		shallowCallback(block, error?): void {
			console.log('shallowCallback', block, error);
		}
	});
}
```
