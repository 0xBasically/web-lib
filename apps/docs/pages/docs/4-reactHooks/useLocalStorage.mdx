# useLocalStorage
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
	The `localStorage` browser API is **asynchronous**. The data will not be available on first React render and your should properly wait for the data to be available to avoid hydratation issue.
</Callout>

This hook a the same as `useState` but this will save the current state in the localStorage at the provided `key` position. You can check [react-recipe](https://github.com/craig1123/react-recipes/blob/master/docs/useLocalStorage.md) repository for more information.

```tsx
import {useLocalStorage} from '@yearn-finance/web-lib/hooks';
```

## Usage

```tsx
import {useLocalStorage} from '@yearn-finance/web-lib/hooks';

function	App() {
	const	[myStoredValue, set_myStoredValue] = useLocalStorage('myKey', myInitialValue);
}
```

## Return Value
```tsx
[unknown, React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<unknown>>]
```

## Configuration

### `key`
This is where, in the localStorage, the value will be stored. This key should be unique to avoid conflicts.
```tsx {5}
import {useLocalStorage} from '@yearn-finance/web-lib/hooks';

function	App() {
	const	[myStoredValue, set_myStoredValue] = useLocalStorage(
		'myKey',
		myInitialValue
	);
}
```

### `initialValue`
If the localStorage is not set yet, this is the default value to set and to use as initial value.
```tsx {6}
import {useLocalStorage} from '@yearn-finance/web-lib/hooks';

function	App() {
	const	[myStoredValue, set_myStoredValue] = useLocalStorage(
		'myKey',
		myInitialValue
	);
}
```
